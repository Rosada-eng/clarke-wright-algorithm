# MDVRP

This is a simple solution for the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP), a variation of the classic VRP.

This implementation uses two steps to solve the problem:
- Attribution
- Routing (Clark and Wright heuristic)


You can run single experiments of [attribution](attribution_example.py) or [routing](routing_example.py) or a [full experiment](full_example.py).
